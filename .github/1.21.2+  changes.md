# CEM and 1.21.2+

This is a summary / report of the changes made to vanilla entity rendering & models in Minecraft release 1.21.2+ 

specifically as to how this will affect EMF & OptiFine CEM pack makers going forwards

These are all reflective of changes in the vanilla game that will have impacts for both EMF and OptiFine CEM.

OptiFine may make some different choices in how they handle these changes, 
but this document is primarily highlighting the vanilla changes, 
and the most straight forward implementation of these changes which EMF will be using until OptiFine decides if they will do things differently.

I will highlight some instance where I expect OptiFine may do things differently, for purposes such as legacy support, or for consistency with their naming conventions.

## Changes

### armor textures
all armor texture locations have changed for humanoids, horses, etc.

same goes for trims.

Emissive trim textures will now be located at `textures/trims/entity/humanoid/<trim_type>_<material>_e.png` or `textures/trims/entity/humanoid_leggings/<trim_type>_<material>_e.png`

These new emissive trim texture locations might change depending on what OptiFine does for 1.21.2+

ETF can now variate armor textures (not trims) as it would any other entity with .properties files, though you will still get much better control via CIT

### all models
every entity model is now rendered directly from their `root` part, prior to this only a few mobs did this.
This means all models may now benefit from having transforms applied to their root parts.

There are still of course several mobs that receive additional rotations and/or scaling outside their root part,
e.g. slime scaling or squid rotations.

### all mob models that can be babies
all baby mobs now use a completely separate model to their adult counterparts, this means baby models parts no longer
get automatically resized during render time and the baby models will need to be made at their actual baby scale.

- "baby" armor stands will use `armor_stand_small`
- All other baby models will use the regular adult name but add `_baby` at the end 
- e.g. `pig_baby.jem`
- this is considered with the entity name so will go before additional words such as saddle here `pig_baby_saddle.jem`
- `elytra_baby.jem` also exists o.O
- all baby mobs also have their own separate armor models, 
e.g. `zombie_baby_inner_armor.jem`, `zombie_baby_outer_armor.jem`. New fallback models `baby_inner_armor.jem` and `baby_outer_armor.jem` have been added to compliment the adult fallbacks.

It should be possible with extra effort for EMF and Optifine to incorporate the baby scaling in CEM models automatically, 
for an amount of backwards compatibility, though EMF is going to take the hands-off approach for now to see what sp will to do with OptiFine CEM.


### humanoid models
All humanoid models with a `headwear` part now internally have their `headwear` part moved to be inside the `head` part.
This means that the `headwear` part will now automatically inherit all custom animation transforms applied to the `head` part.

*This does break all humanoid head models in Fresh Animations :(*

### player models
Just like the change for `headwear` and `head` listed above, all of the second skin layer parts of the player model are 
now moved to be inside their base part. e.g. `left_sleeve` is now inside `left_arm`. Meaning they will now all inherit the
custom animation transforms of their base part.

*This will break most custom player animation packs unless they use different cubes*

the player model no longer includes the `ear` & `cloak` parts, these are now separate models I will detail further below.

### boat models
different boat type models now use the format <wood_type>_<boat_type>.jem e.g. `oak_boat.jem`, `oak_chest_boat.jem`, and the rafts `bamboo_raft.jem`, `bamboo_chest_raft.jem`
this differs from EMF previously using their vanilla model id such as `boat/oak.jem`

the models `boat.jem`, `raft.jem`, and their chest equivalents, still exist as fallbacks for all boats and rafts if their specific type model doesn't exist.

the `bottom_no_water` part is no longer found inside the boat model and instead has its own separate model detailed further below.

### some models that get rescaled during render time
Certain models, `elder_guardian`, `giant`, `cave_spider`, `cat` possibly more. Used to get rescaled during render time.

For example `cave_spider.jem` and `spider.jem` were both the same size in the model file, but the `cave_spider` would be scaled down during render time.

Now the model itself is what gets scaled down, so `cave_spider.jem` should now be smaller than `spider.jem` in the model file.

It should be possible with extra effort for EMF and Optifine to incorporate this scaling to cem models automatically,
for an amount of backwards compatibility, though EMF is going to take the hands-off approach for now to see what sp will to do with OptiFine CEM.

## new models

some new entity models were added, some of these already existed via special additional code in EMF and OptiFine (such as arrows)
and will likely experience changes in how they are rendered.

### ear models
the `ear` part of the player model is now a separate model, `player_ears.jem`, this is rendered after the player model.

### cloak models
the `cloak` part of the player model is now a separate model, `player_cape.jem`, this is rendered after the player model.
EMF did previously have a custom implementation for `player_cape.jem` this has been removed in all 1.21.2+ versions, 
and will eventually be backported in a way that fully replicates this new vanilla model's pivots and transforms.

### bottom_no_water models
the `bottom_no_water` part of the boat model is now a separate model, `boat_water_patch.jem`, this is rendered after the boat model.
note: the model name may change when OptiFine updates to 1.21.2+

### arrow models
the arrow model now exists in vanilla, `arrow.jem` and likely has different pivot values to OptiFine & EMF's custom 
`arrow.jem` implementation used previously.

### bee stinger models
the bee stinger model now exists in vanilla, with the model name `bee_stinger.jem` in EMF.

### salmon size models
different salmon size models now exist in vanilla, with the model names `salmon.jem`, `salmon_large.jem`, `salmon_small.jem` in EMF.
